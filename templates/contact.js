    I took my power in my hand<br/>
    And went against the world;<br/>
    ’Twas not so much as David had,<br/>
    But I was twice as bold.<br/>

    I aimed my pebble, but myself<br/>
    Was all the one that fell.<br/>
    Was it Goliath was too large,<br/>
    Or only I too small?<br/><br/>

    -Emily Dickinson

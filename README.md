### FermiDirak

Fermi and Dirak were two scientists who jointly established the field of statistical quantum physics. A very fancy sounding field for sure--but really, their work didn't just impact the Physics community. The formulas and mathematical insight they brought to the scientific community in general were tremendous and have had a significant impact on modern statistics as we know it. My alias serves as a tribute to their legacies and their contributions to our human understanding of the nature of the universe.
